# halloween_candy_dispensor

Halloween was hit pretty hard by covid and the social distance constraints of passing out candy, leaving basically two options that I had seen for solutions,
both of which i was not very impressed with. 
The first being, a 6 foot long piece of pvc tube that the person distributing the candy would slide through the tube to the reciever at the other end...
The second being, a bowl of candy on the porch while standing in the house with a glass door between the home owner and the trick-or-treat-er...

Both of which were viable and cheap solutions to a rather unique circumstance which hasn't been seen before in my lifetime, which sparked the idea of building
a rather cheap automation solution and a fun way to pass out candy with the ability to apply the mechanism to already existing decorations, or build a decoration
to work in conjunction with the mechanism or even to just be used as a stand alone device.

I created a file called "covid_candy" - this is a simple program to be ran on an Arduino UNO, using an HC-SR04 distance sensor, and an 28BYJ-48 stepper motor
and their respective libraries, in combination with some random materials everyone should have around the house, to create and automate a candy dispensor while 
keeping adequate social distance for Halloween.
